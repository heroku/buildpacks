# Contributing Guide for Heroku Cloud Native Buildpacks

This page lists the operational governance model of this project, as well as
the recommendations and requirements for how to best contribute to Heroku
Cloud Native Buildpacks. We strive to obey these as best as possible. As
always, thanks for contributing.

## Governance Model: Salesforce Sponsored

The intent and goal of open sourcing this project is to increase the contributor
and user base. However, only Salesforce employees will be given `admin` rights
and will be the final arbitrars of what contributions are accepted or not.

## Getting started

[Heroku Cloud Native Buildpacks discussions](https://github.com/heroku/buildpacks/discussions).

## Issues, Feature Requests, and Bug Reports

each buildpack repository:

If you find an issue and/or bug, please search issues for the relevant
buildpack repository, and if it isn't already tracked, create a new issue. If
you aren't sure which repository the issue or bug report applies to, use
[Heroku Cloud Native Buildpacks Discussions](https://github.com/heroku/buildpacks/discussions)
instead.

## Fixes, Improvements, and Patches

Fixes, improvements, and patches all happen via GitHub Pull Requests on our
buildpack repositories. If you'd like to improve the tests, you want to make
the documentation clearer, you have an alternative implementation of something
that may have advantages over the way its currently done, or you have any other
change, we would be happy to hear about it. For trivial changes, send a pull
request to the appropriate buildpack repository:

- [heroku/go](https://github.com/heroku/buildpacks-go/pulls)
- [heroku/jvm](https://github.com/heroku/buildpacks-jvm/pulls)
- [heroku/nodejs](https://github.com/heroku/buildpacks-nodejs/pulls)
