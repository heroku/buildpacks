# Heroku <%= language_name %> Cloud Native Buildpack (CNB) Tutorial

Build a <%= tutorial_type %> application image in 5 minutes, no Dockerfile required.

At the end of this tutorial, you'll have a working [OCI image](https://opencontainers.org/) of a <%= tutorial_type %> application that can run locally. You will learn about the Cloud Native Buildpack (CNB) ecosystem, and how to utilize the [pack CLI](https://buildpacks.io/docs/for-platform-operators/how-to/integrate-ci/pack/) to build images without the need to write or maintain a Dockerfile.

> You can now also use the `<%= buildpack_name %>` CNB on Heroku [Fir generation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/generations#fir) via the [pilot program](https://hello.heroku.com/next-generation-sign-up). See the [Getting started on Heroku Fir Dev Center tutorial](<%= fir_tutorial_url %>).
