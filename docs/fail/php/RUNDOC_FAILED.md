## What does `pack build` do?

> [!NOTE]
> Skip ahead if you want to run the application first and get into the details later.

When you run `pack build` with a builder, each buildpack runs a detection script to determine if it should be eligible to build the application. In our case the `heroku/php` buildpack found a `composer.json` file. As a result, the buildpack has enough information to install PHP dependencies. You can view a list of the buildpacks used in the build output:


```
===> DETECTING
2 of 3 buildpacks participating
heroku/php      1.1.0
heroku/procfile 4.2.1
===> RESTORING
Skipping buildpack layer analysis
```

After the detect phase, each buildpack will execute. Buildpacks can inspect your project, install files to disk, run commands, write environment variables, [and more](https://buildpacks.io/docs/for-buildpack-authors/). You can see some examples of that in the output above. For example, the PHP buildpack installs dependencies from the `composer.json` automatically:
